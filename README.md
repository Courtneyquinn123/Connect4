# Connect Four Game

This project is an implementation of the classic game Connect Four using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Connect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of your color.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the game board and restart button.
- **style.css**: Defines the styles for the game board, cells, and players' discs.
- **script.js**: Implements the game logic and functionality.

## How to Play

To play the game, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Players take turns clicking on the columns to drop their colored discs. The game automatically detects winning combinations and announces the winner. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player functionality: Players take turns dropping discs of their color.
- Automatic win detection: The game checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of four discs after each move.
- Restart button: Allows players to reset the game board and start a new game.

Enjoy playing Connect Four!
